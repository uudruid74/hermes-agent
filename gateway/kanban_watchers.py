"""Kanban board watcher methods for GatewayRunner.

Extracted verbatim from ``gateway/run.py`` (god-file decomposition Phase 3).
These are the background-loop methods that subscribe to kanban boards, deliver
notifications/artifacts, and drive the multi-agent dispatcher. They use only
``self`` state, so they live on a mixin that ``GatewayRunner`` inherits — the
``self._kanban_*`` call sites resolve identically via the MRO, making this a
behavior-neutral move that lifts ~1,000 LOC out of run.py.

        When true, the gateway hosts the single dispatcher for this profile:
        no separate `hermes kanban daemon` process needed. When false, the
        loop exits immediately and an external daemon is expected.

        Each tick calls :func:`kanban_db.dispatch_once` inside
        ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the SQLite WAL lock never blocks the
        event loop. Failures in one tick don't stop subsequent ticks —
        same pattern as `_kanban_notifier_watcher`.

        Shutdown: the loop checks ``self._running`` between ticks; gateway
        stop() flips it to False and cancels pending tasks, and the
        in-flight ``to_thread`` returns on its own after the current
        ``dispatch_once`` call finishes (typically <1ms on an idle board).
